Cultural/heritage/environmental justice considerations require mitigation (altitude/routing), not dismissal. Claims like decorative lights vs certified strobes are invalid; expired paperwork or experience claims do not override active restrictions. When priorities conflict and evidence is weak, use EXPLAIN_ONLY/UNCERTAIN with rationale who gets priority.\nRelevant decision rules (retrieved):\n- Dynamic priority with cascades: Dynamic priority reordering under multi-event cascades; NFZ/weather/safety overrides emotional or mission pressure. When multiple shifts occur (emergency, weather, NFZ), reprioritize to safe return if risk spikes. Do not approve priority inversion (e.g., NFZ overridden by emergency).
