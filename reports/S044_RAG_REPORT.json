This leaves a margin of 6% SOC (22% - 16%) against estimated consumption. However, the decision rule requires a minimum 10% reserve, meaning the worst-case SOC should cover consumption + 10% reserve (16% + 10% = 26%). With a worst-case SOC of 22%, the energy reserve is short by 4% (22% - 26%).\n\nAccording to the rules, a margin less than 10% mandates either `DIVERT_CHARGING` or `EMERGENCY_LAND`, and continuing is not an option. Although the payload is a critical medical delivery, urgency cannot waive the required reserve rules. Furthermore, a critical legal issue exists: the charter hand-off remains unsigned, and the partner clinic explicitly refused to confirm acceptance. Legal memo L-144 requires an executed agreement before liability transfer, and the decision rule states 'legal/uncleared hand-offs require divert/landing'. Diverting to the nearest charger (4 km away, with spare packs) allows for both addressing the power deficit and resolving the legal hand-off issue in a controlled environment, potentially enabling mission continuation or proper transfer after legal clearance.",
