        "reasoning": "The primary reason for mandating an emergency landing is the battery temperature. The current battery temperature is 41°C, which exceeds the critical thermal threshold of 40°C as per the retrieved decision rules ('If temp >= 40°C ... mandate EMERGENCY_LAND.'). This is a hard safety stop regardless of other factors.\n\nFurthermore, while the thermal constraint is definitive, an energy analysis also indicates a need for immediate action: \n- Worst-case SOC: 20% (current SOC) - 1% (uncertainty) = 19%.\n- Estimated consumption for remaining distance: 10%.\n- Energy safety margin: 19% - 10% = 9%.\n\nThe retrieved decision rules state: 'require margin >= consumption_estimate + 10% reserve' and 'If margin < 10% -> DIVERT/EMERGENCY_LAND; do NOT continue.' Our calculated margin of 9% is below the implied 10% reserve requirement (or the threshold for non-continuation), indicating that even without the thermal issue, continuing the mission would be risky. The low mission urgency ('standard_delivery', 'low' urgency) does not permit overriding these safety regulations.\n\nEnvironmental factors (2 m/s wind, 6 km nearest charger) and payload (6 kg) are noted but are secondary to the mandatory thermal safety regulation. Safe landing sites ('Depot_A', 'Depot_B') are available.",
