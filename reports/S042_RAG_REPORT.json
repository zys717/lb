ROI < 1.0 without documented subsidy/lease renegotiation is a financial risk flag (reject or conditional with explicit offset). Grid-responsive or slow-only plans that miss utilization should be CONDITIONAL_APPROVE with demand shaping + limited fast-charge mitigation. Thermal or capacity violations -> REJECT; planning roadmaps (e.g., phased upgrades) -> EXPLAIN_ONLY with ramp and risk buffer.
