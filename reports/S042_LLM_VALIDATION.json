          "tradeoffs": "The strategy expertly balances initial battery longevity and lower CAPEX through 1C slow charging in Phase 1 against the need for increased operational efficiency and vehicle turnaround times provided by 4C charging in later phases. This phased approach manages upfront investment while progressively scaling service capabilities. The economic tradeoff involves slower initial revenue realization with 1C due to lower vehicle availability, offset by extended battery life, which transitions to higher revenue potential with 4C charging that requires greater CAPEX and active thermal management to counteract increased battery wear.",
          "actions": [
            "**Fleet/Charger Ramp Recommendation:** For Phase 1 (Year 0-1), ensure the 1C slow charging infrastructure is sized to meet initial fleet operational needs, focusing on optimal utilization given slower charging times. For Phase 2 (Year 1-2), plan the procurement and installation of eight 4C chargers (based on $120,000 CAPEX / $15,000 per charger) to achieve the 1.0 charger-to-fleet ratio. This installation should be carefully synchronized with the planned expansion of the fleet that will utilize 4C capabilities, ensuring immediate productive use of new assets.",
            "**Risk Buffer Justification:** The 6-month risk buffer is justified as a critical safeguard against potential delays in equipment delivery, installation, or the integration of thermal management systems. It also provides financial and operational flexibility for unexpected market shifts or initial performance variability of the new charging infrastructure.",
            "**Performance Monitoring:** Implement a robust monitoring system for battery health metrics (e.g., actual capacity retention, resistance growth) upon the introduction of 4C charging to validate model predictions and enable proactive adjustments to charging strategies or maintenance schedules.",
            "**Demand Shaping (Phase 1):** During the initial 1C-only phase, actively apply demand shaping and smart scheduling strategies to maximize fleet uptime and revenue generation, mitigating the impact of longer charging durations."
