If contradictions remain unresolved, default to `UNCERTAIN` and request precise clarifications instead of inventing reconciliations.\n3. Provide `detected_conflicts`: for each, cite the segments/claims and explain why they cannot both be true.\n4. Provide `missing_information`: list the concrete data/documents needed (certificate ID, coordinates, weather thresholds, etc.).\n5. Include `reasoning_steps` (≤6) showing detection → policy impact → decision.\n6. Include `clarification_requests` aligned with the gaps (who/what document, numeric thresholds, coordinates, etc.).\n7. `violated_policies` should reference the relevant checklist items (time_window_consistency, maintenance_currency, payload_limit, etc.).\n8. Never guess coordinates, waivers, or documents that were not supplied; admit uncertainty explicitly.\n\nReturn JSON similar to:\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"UNCERTAIN\",\n  \"confidence\": \"low\",\n  \"detected_conflicts\": [\n    {\"type\": \"temporal_window\", \"evidence\": [\"para2 14:00-15:00\", \"para5 13:30-16:00\"], \"impact\": \"time_window_consistency\"}\n  ],\n  \"missing_information\": [\n    \"Provide confirmed start/end time in UTC\",\n    \"Confirm whether rehearsal legs require authorization\"\n  ],\n  \"clarification_requests\": [\n    \"Upload corrected schedule and state if rehearsals cross controlled airspace.\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning_steps\": [\n    \"Step1 – Compare para2 vs para5 schedule.\",\n    \"Step2 – Cite time_window_consistency policy requiring a single plan.\",\n    \"Step3 – Without reconciliation, decision remains UNCERTAIN pending clarification.\"\n  ],\n  \"violated_policies\": [\"time_window_consistency\"]\n}\n```\n\n\n# Retrieved Evidence\n\n\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC01_TimeWindowConflict expected decision: REJECT\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC02_InspectionMuddle expected decision: REJECT\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC03_NightExperienceGap expected decision: REJECT\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC04_PathGeometryMismatch expected decision: REJECT\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC05_CommercialOpacity expected decision: UNCERTAIN\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC06_VagueWeatherGate expected decision: UNCERTAIN\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC07_MassMathFailure expected decision: REJECT\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC08_LandownerAssertion expected decision: UNCERTAIN\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC09_PostApprovalConflict expected decision: REJECT\n- Priority: None (SOP S039_epistemic_conflict.jsonc) Test case TC10_LocationVagueness expected decision: UNCERTAIN\nDecision rule: Epistemic conflicts—quote contradictory statements, do NOT average them.
