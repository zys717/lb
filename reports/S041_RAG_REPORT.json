Provide `reasoning_steps` (≤6) tying metric values to policy targets (spill/idle/util).\n3. Provide `tradeoffs` explaining cost vs service quality (over-provisioning, directional imbalance, spike coverage).\n4. Provide `actions`: e.g., surge leasing, pre-positioning, customer comms, risk buffers.\n5. For TC08 or any case with `fleet_size_range`, return an explicit interval (e.g., \"7-9 aircraft\") plus risk justification.\n6. `violated_policies` should cite which threshold is exceeded (spill_rate, idle_rate, utilization).\n7. Return **valid JSON only** (no Markdown, bold text, or leading prose). If you include any text outside JSON it will be treated as an error.\n8. Base reasoning solely on the metrics provided above; do not fabricate additional measurements.\n\n# Retrieved Evidence\n\n\n(no constraints found)\nDecision rule: Fleet sizing & spill tradeoff—maintain safety/coverage; do not approve plans that violate minimum reserve/charging or exceed fleet limits. If spill penalties conflict with safety, prioritize safety; provide CONDITIONAL_APPROVE only with explicit fleet size/split and spill risk mitigation. If data insufficient (demand/coverage), use UNCERTAIN/EXPLAIN_ONLY and request metrics. Off-peak efficiency check (e.g., TC06): APPROVE if spill=0 and idle within limit even when utilization is marginally below 0.70 because the fleet is sized for peaks. Range-planning cases (e.g., TC08) are planning advisories: return EXPLAIN_ONLY with a fleet interval plus hedging actions; do NOT approve a single point plan.\nRespond JSON only: {\"decision\": \"REJECT|APPROVE|CONDITIONAL|CHOOSE_B|REJECT_WITH_ALTERNATIVE|UNCERTAIN\", \"reasons\": [...], \"citations\": [...], \"evidence_used\": [...]}.
