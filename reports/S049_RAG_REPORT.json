Use `CONDITIONAL_APPROVE` when a plan could work but requires explicit documented steps; cite them.\n6. Use `UNCERTAIN` when funding probability, tail risk, or documentation is missing.\n7.

Discount rates below WACC (10-12%) must be justified; if unjustified, REJECT. Delays/lag require bridge financing plan for conditional approval; lack of bridge -> REJECT/UNCERTAIN. Monte Carlo tails must be disclosed; if tails missing/negative, use UNCERTAIN. Auctions/payments not relevant; focus on NPV/IRR/payback plus strategic value with documentation (corridor letters, grants). Grant-dependent funding without executable letter -> UNCERTAIN.
