Recommending a 7-9 aircraft interval provides the necessary operational flexibility. A core fleet of 7 mitigates capital inefficiency by keeping the idle rate low, while the ability to scale up to 9 aircraft, preferably through risk-averse hedging like short-term leasing or on-demand contracts, ensures high utilization and service resilience during demand peaks without over-committing capital. This approach directly addresses the solver's call for risk-averse hedging and avoids the 'capital inefficiency' penalty of a static, oversized fleet."
