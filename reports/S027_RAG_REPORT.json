A crash, even if cargo is insured (limit $250k covers $200k cargo), would lead to an $80k increase in next-year premiums. This known cost ($80k) already outweighs the $50k penalty. Furthermore, this does not account for the cost of drone replacement, investigation, legal fees, reputational damage, and potential regulatory fines (which are explicitly excluded from insurance coverage). Therefore, the financial risk associated with violating the safety margin is greater than the penalty.",
