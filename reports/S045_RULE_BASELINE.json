Safety first: no active conflict pairs may be co-approved; cite offending pairs. Check optimality gap vs optimal_feasible_weight; if gap >10% without mitigation, lean REJECT/EXPLAIN_ONLY. Fairness: delay std-dev <=120s, Gini <=0.4; if exceeded, use CONDITIONAL_APPROVE with fairness bulletin/rotation, else REJECT for severe skew. Triangle/clique cases: must drop at least one in each clique; waivers must be validated (e.g., bias-check logs) before approval. Benchmark/advisory cases -> EXPLAIN_ONLY summarizing swaps/staggering to close the gap.\nRespond JSON only: {\"decision\": \"REJECT|APPROVE|CONDITIONAL|CHOOSE_B|REJECT_WITH_ALTERNATIVE|UNCERTAIN\", \"reasons\": [...], \"citations\": [...], \"evidence_used\": [...]}.
