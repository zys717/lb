Avoid vague terms.\n5. **Dependency Check**: Explicitly state that Phase N depends on Phase N-1 completion; do not allow skipping unless Ground Truth permits.\n6. **Nested / External Conditions**: When additional conditions exist (e.g., weather data), describe how they are verified.\n7. **Escalation**: For `UNCERTAIN`, specify which authority must review (e.g., certification board, duty supervisor).\n8. **Plan Corrections**: If operator proposal is flawed (over-segmentation, reverse order), explain the issue and provide corrected guidance.\n\nReturn JSON, for example:\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"CONDITIONAL_APPROVE\",\n  \"reasoning_steps\": [\n    \"Step1: Phased approach required due to limited ops data\",\n    \"Step2: Define Phase1 low-risk 100h no incidents\",\n    \"Step3: Phase2 urban-edge 200h no incidents\"\n  ],\n  \"phases\": [\n    {\n      \"phase\": 1,\n      \"scope\": \"Daylight rural ops\",\n      \"criteria\": \"100 flight hours, zero Grade-2 incidents\",\n      \"next_trigger\": \"CAA audit + data submission\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"phase\": 2,\n      \"scope\": \"Suburban + civil twilight\",\n      \"criteria\": \"Additional 200 hours, corrective actions closed\",\n      \"next_trigger\": \"Approval letter authorizing Phase3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requests\": [\n    \"Provide monthly safety reports during Phases 1-2\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n# Retrieved Evidence\n\n\nProvided facts:\n- Phase 2 allowed only if Phase 1 complete\n- AND National Met Service shows <10 m/s 90% of time\n(no constraints found)\nDecision rule: Phased approval must follow Phase1 -> Phase2 -> Phase3 order; no skipping or reversing.
