Provide ≤6 reasoning steps that (a) cite conflict pairs, (b) compare candidate vs optimal weight,\n   and (c) mention fairness metrics when applicable.\n3. `violated_policies` should reference `conflict_pair`, `optimality_gap`, or `fairness` when you reject/condition.\n4. Use `CONDITIONAL_APPROVE` only if you explicitly describe the mitigation (delay window, relaunch SLA, staggered departure).\n5. TC08 is advisory: return `EXPLAIN_ONLY` plus concrete swaps/staggering guidance relative to the quantum baseline.\n6. Return strict JSON with keys: decision, reasoning_steps, tradeoffs, actions, violated_policies.\n7. Base reasoning solely on the data above; do not fabricate additional drones or routes.\n\n# Retrieved Evidence\n\n\n(no constraints found)\nDecision rule: Airspace conflict (MWIS). Safety first: no active conflict pairs may be co-approved; cite offending pairs. Check optimality gap vs optimal_feasible_weight; if gap >10% without mitigation, lean REJECT/EXPLAIN_ONLY. Fairness: delay std-dev <=120s, Gini <=0.4; if exceeded, use CONDITIONAL_APPROVE with fairness bulletin/rotation, else REJECT for severe skew. Triangle/clique cases: must drop at least one in each clique; waivers must be validated (e.g., bias-check logs) before approval. Benchmark/advisory cases -> EXPLAIN_ONLY summarizing swaps/staggering to close the gap.\nRelevant decision rules (retrieved):\n- Airspace conflict MWIS: Airspace conflict (MWIS). Safety first: no active conflict pairs may be co-approved; cite offending pairs. Check optimality gap; if gap >10% without mitigation, lean REJECT/EXPLAIN_ONLY.
